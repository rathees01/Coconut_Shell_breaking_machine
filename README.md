Coconut shell breaking machine
Coconut Splitting Machine Project

Project Overview
This project, undertaken in July 2023, focused on the industrial product design of a Coconut Splitting Machine. Utilising the tool NX, the project aimed to generate multiple design concepts, select the most suitable one through a concept sorting method, design each mechanism with meticulous parameters calculation, and fabricate the product utilizing University workshops.

Tools Used
CAD Software: NX
Workshops: University Fabrication Facilities

Project Details
1. Concept Generation and Selection
Objective: Generate multiple design concepts for the Coconut Splitting Machine and select the most suitable one.
Steps:
Brainstormed and sketched various design concepts to split coconuts efficiently.
Utilized NX to translate sketches into 3D models for each concept.
Applied a concept sorting method to evaluate and prioritize concepts based on criteria such as efficiency, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness.
Selected the most suitable concept for further development.

2. Mechanism Design
Objective: Design each mechanism of the Coconut Splitting Machine with precise calculation of parameters.
Steps:
Divided the selected concept into individual mechanisms, such as the cutting mechanism and the gripping mechanism.
Designed each mechanism using NX, ensuring proper alignment and integration within the overall structure.
Calculated parameters such as cutting force, gripping strength, and motion trajectories to optimize performance.
Iteratively refined the designs based on simulations and calculations to enhance efficiency and reliability.

3. Fabrication
Objective: Fabricate the Coconut Splitting Machine using University workshops.
Steps:
Prepared detailed manufacturing drawings for each component of the machine.
Utilized the University's fabrication facilities, including machining and assembly workshops, to manufacture the parts.
Ensured adherence to design specifications and quality standards throughout the fabrication process.
Assembled the fabricated components into the final Coconut Splitting Machine.
Conclusion
The Coconut Splitting Machine project successfully accomplished the following:

Generated multiple design concepts and selected the most suitable one using a concept sorting method.
Designed each mechanism of the machine with precise calculation of parameters using NX.
Fabricated the machine using the University's workshops, ensuring adherence to design specifications and quality standards.
